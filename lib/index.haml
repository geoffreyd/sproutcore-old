-# SPROUTCORE DEFAULT INDEX TEMPLATE FOR Haml
-# This template provide provides a basic wrapper for a SproutCore client.
-# Most of the time, it will be sufficient for your own needs.  However, if
-# you need to create your own template, you can do so by copying this file
-# into your client, naming it 'index.rhtml' and then adding the options
-# :index => 'index' to your client declaration in routes.rb.

    %title= yield(:page_title) || (@title.to_s || bundle_name.to_s || '').capitalize
    %script{ :src => static_url('detect-browser'), :type => "text/javascript" }

    -# This line should appear in your head area to include the stylesheets
    -# generated by your client.  If you need to include your own
    -# stylesheets, you don't need to change it here. Instead, name your
    -# stylesheets for the :stylesheet_libs option in sc-config, or
    -# add for example the following to your haml file:
    -#
    -#  - content_for :page_style do
    -#    %link{ :href => static_url('my_style'), :rel => "stylesheet", :type => "text/css" }
    -#
    = stylesheets_for_client
    = yield :page_styles

    -# Add any other things you want to add to the page <head> section via 
    -#   - content_for :page_header do
    -#
    = yield :page_head

    -# This is where you root body element will appear.  To cause your
    -# content to appear here, just declare content_for :body do in one of
    -# your partials. For example:
    -#    - content_for :body do
    -#      Hello Sproutcore
    -#
    / Main Page Body
    = yield :body

    -# This is where the resources you delcare will appear.  You must
    -# include the following three lines verbatim for the resources you
    -# declare to be properly used.
    -#
    / Resources to be removed from DOM on page load
    #resources{ :style => "display:none; visibility:hidden;" }
      = yield :resources

    -# This line should appear at the bottom of your page to include your
    -# generated JavaScript and any libraries you reference.  If you need
    -# to include other javascripts then instead of changing it here, add
    -# them to the :javascript_libs option in your sc-config, or add for
    -# example the following to your haml file:
    -#
    -#  -content_for :page_javascript do
    -#    %script :type => "text/javascript" src => static_url('my_javascript') }
    -#
    / Include Site Javascript
    = javascripts_for_client
    = yield :page_javascript

    - # The following lines to the closing body tag must be included at the
    - # very end of your file.  This will actually setup the JavaScript
    - # views on your page and register SproutCore to start on page load.
    / Render Page Views
